## Project Overview

This library provides React components that wrap CropperJS 2.x custom elements, offering a React-friendly API for the latest version of the popular image cropping library.

## Goals

- Provide seamless React integration for CropperJS 2.x web components
- Maintain TypeScript type safety throughout
- Offer both low-level component access and high-level convenience APIs
- Support all CropperJS 2.x features including multiple selections

## Technology Stack

- React 18+
- TypeScript
- CropperJS 2.x
- Bundler: TBD (Vite/Rollup)
- Testing: TBD (Vitest/Jest)

## Development Status

ðŸš§ **Initial Setup Phase**

## Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Dual API Approach**: Provide both low-level web component wrappers and high-level React-friendly components
2. **TypeScript First**: Full type definitions for all components and APIs
3. **Modern Tooling**: Use latest React patterns (hooks, refs, TypeScript)
4. **Web Standards**: Embrace web components while maintaining React idioms
